# SoilHydraulicParameter
#1_This repository is used to save soil hydraulic parameters calculating code
#2_The Origin data in the R files should be arranged into three columns
#3_First column name is id, which saves the number of each site
#4_Second column name is h_t, which saves the water head value (mH2O), corresponding to soil matrix potential
#5_Third column name is theta_t, which saves the measured gravimetric soil water content
